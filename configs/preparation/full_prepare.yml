# This is an example of a configuration file for `cli_prepare.py`.

# The whole preparation pipeline is in the given order: cleaning -> records_selection -> feature_engineering -> feature_selection

# Some of the steps from the beginning or the end can be skipped, however no step can't be skipped "from the middle".
# Valid approaches where the input paths are specified for the first step that is defined:
#   - cleaning
#   - cleaning -> records_selection
#   - feature_engineering -> feature_selection
#   - ...
# Invalid approaches even with input paths specified for the first step:
#   - cleaning -> feature_engineering
#   - records_selection -> feature_selection
#   - ...

# Optionally, each step that is not the last one can have defined output paths if the some of the results are wanted.
# For example, it could be useful to store the dataset after feature selection but also after records selection.
# And later on when there are changes to feature engineering then the cleaning and records selection can be safely skipped.

# Please note that input paths are completely ignored except for the first step in the pipeline used in the given config.
# For example, ignore input paths for everything except cleaning when cleaning is defined.

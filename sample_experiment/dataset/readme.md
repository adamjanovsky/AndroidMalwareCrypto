# Sample dataset

This is a sample dataset for a toy experiment, containing 10 malicious APKs. These APKs contain various cryptographic API and should create fairly rich report. There are two main ways of providing a dataset:

## 1. Supply your own APKs

In that case, create a folder called `dataset_folder/data/apk` and fill it with multiple APKs. In [experiment config](../experiment_output/config.yml) specify the key `dataset_path: dataset_folder/`.

## 2. Download from Androzoo

In this case, create an empty folder called `dataset_folder` and navigate the [experiment_config](../experiment_output/config.yml) to find it, using the key: `dataset_path: dataset_folder/`. Our tool will download the dataset in there.

Please note that the [meta.yml](meta.yml) is automatically created and does not need to be supplied. This file reports basic characteristics about the dataset.

# Contributing

This project is very dirty. Namely:

- There are no tests
- Pinned dependencies kinda work together, but `pip-tools` unused.
- No `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` and we use custom Androguard mirror
    - The motivation to do so is that while the Androguard published fix for our problem to Master, there's no PyPi release since 2019
- Readthedocs is crawling the repo automatically and publishing new docs (there is no explicit GitHub action to trigger this behaviour)
- There's no automated linting, code formatting
- Docker image is pushed to dockerhub on every published release (published on GitHub)
- `main` branch is protected

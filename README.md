# AndroidMalwareCrypto
The analysis of cryptography in Android malicious applications. All knowledge regarding this project shall reside in the readme file if not stated otherwise.

## Install 

The project is tested on python 3.6. It should suffice to clone, install requirements and run (you may want to get the Neptune.ml token, see [Neptune integration](#neptune-integration) below). 

*Note: At the moment, development version of the [pyjadx](https://github.com/romainthomas/pyjadx) package is used. You must install this version manually and delete it from the requirements.txt, as it's not in the pip repositories yet.*

To install, use

```
git clone https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto.git &&
cd AndroidMalwareCrypto &&
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 ./setup.py install
```

## Usage

```
python3 ./cli.py <path_to_yaml_config> -t <optional_neptune_api_token_base64>
```

## Architecture

The main logical unit of the project is an `experiment`. Experiment does not have its own class, but is operated in three dimensions:

1) An `ExperimentConfig` class parses the input from yaml configuration file, see [config example](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/blob/master/sample_configs/base64.yml).

2) An `ExperimentRunner` calls the task specified in `ExperimentConfig`.

3) A `Task` class does the heavy lifting. To be specific, it's an abstract class, parent class of various specific tasks that do the heavy lifting, e.g. `DeobfuscateBase64` task. These tasks inherit the global structure from the parent class. 

If correctly thought, this architecture should survive the whole development cycle and be maintained. At the moment, it is sort of possible to define multiple experiments within single configuration file, we could extend the source code to run them. 

## Neptune integration

The project is meant to be fully integrated with [Neptune.ml](Neptune.ml). This allows us to track all experiments perfmored with the project. The `Team/Project_name` is to be supplied from the config file, whereas the personal API token is supplied as a command-line parameter. 

## License

MIT, but should be decided when we publish it...

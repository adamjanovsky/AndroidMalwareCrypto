# AndroidMalwareCrypto
The analysis of cryptography in Android malicious applications

Welcome to the AndroidMalwareCrypto wiki!

So far, all knowledge about the project will be present here. 

## Install 

The project is tested on python 3.6. It should suffice to clone, install requirements and run (you may want to get the Neptune.ml token, see [Neptune integration](#neptune-integration) below. 

_Note: At the moment, development version of the [pyjadx](https://github.com/romainthomas/pyjadx) package is used. You must install this version manually and delete it from the requirements.txt, as it's not in the pip repositories yet. _

To install, use

```
git clone https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto.git &&
cd AndroidMalwareCrypto &&
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 ./setup.py install
```

## Usage

TBA


## Architecture

The main logical unit of the project is an `experiment`. Experiment does not have its own class, but is operated in three dimensions:

1) An `ExperimentConfig` class parses the input from yaml configfile, see [config example](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/blob/master/sample_configs/base64.yml)

## Neptune integration

The project is meant to be fully integrated with [Neptune.ml](Neptune.ml). This allows us to track all experiments perfmored with the project. The `Team/Project_name` is to be supplied from the config file, whereas the personal API token is supplied as a command-line parameter.

# AndroidMalwareCrypto

This tool allows for an analysis of cryptographic API in Android applications. The tool was especially developed to compare cryptographic API usage in benign vs. malicious applications and contains (weak) malware classifier based purely on cryptographic API features. We strive to provide end-to-end solution, automating all steps in the analysis:
1. Decompilation of APKs,
2. collection of cryptographic API usage in the decompiled binaries,
3. exploratory data analysis of crypto API in your dataset,
4. training and evaluation of malware classifier based on crypto API features,
5. explanations of the classifier using [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).

We provide notebooks that allow you to work directly with our prepared datasets. Additionally, we describe a controlled environment and guidance for anyone who wishes to fully replicate our research on our [wiki](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/wiki).

## Install 

The project is written and tested on Python 3.8. Apart from bare Python, the tool requires integration with some patched repositories. Due to complex installation process, we offer a Docker image of our tool that can be run interactively. In addition, the [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) contains consise instructions on how to install our tool on vanilla Ubuntu.

## Explore our datasets

To be written. Open MyBinder and explore our main results.

## Run complete analysis on toy dataset in Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you havenâ€™t already,
2. pull the image with `docker pull adamjanovsky/cryptomlw:latest`,
3. run the image interactively with `docker run -it adamjanovsky/cryptomlw`,
4. now you can run your experiments, e.g. with 
```
cd AndroidMalwareCrypto \
&& ./cli_process.py sample_experiment/configs/dataset_processing/config_processing.yml
```
5. you can then view the output of the experiment in `/home/user/AndroidMalwareCrypto/sample_experiment/dataset/`.

It is recommended that you set up a [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) outside of the container and use it in combination with the image to produce results stored on your local folder outside of the docker container.

## Analyze your own large dataset

Analyzing large dataset (>100 APKs) in Docker can be slow. For that reason, we recomment that you visit our [wiki](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/wiki) where full protocol of how to replicate our research is written.

## Project status & Contributing

We consider this project to be complete on the Android platform. Still, we plan to continue our exploration of cryptography in malware on other platforms. If you think of helping us with these efforts, you discovered a bug, or perhaps you want to enhance the functionality of `androidcrypto`, please do not hessiate to [open an issue](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/issues) or [contact the authors](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#authors).

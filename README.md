# AndroidMalwareCrypto
The analysis of cryptographic API in Android applications. All knowledge regarding this project shall reside in the readme file if not stated otherwise. 

**TODO:** The list of malware labels can be downloaded from [https://androzoo.uni.lu/labels](Androzoo web), from each folder `types` and `names` provide file `proposal.json`. Also, explain that `label` is a special task performed at the end of processing (so that we don't have to hold the whole labeling dataset in memory 200MB).

## Install 

The project is tested on Python 3.8. It should suffice to clone and install requirements. Additionally, it may be necessary to integrate with some services depending on the analysis tasks you wish to perform. Please see [architecture](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/tree/master#architecture) for more details.

If you want to install full version capable of performing all tasks, perform:

1. Install the androidcrypto package

```
git clone https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto.git &&
cd AndroidMalwareCrypto &&
pip3 install -r requirements.txt &&
python3 ./setup.py install
```

2. Install [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
3. Installed patched version of Androguard (see [Androguard and jadx integration](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#androguard-and-jadx-integration))
4. Install [Literadar](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/LiteRadar) (optional)
5. Get yourself an [neptune.ai](neptune.ai) token (optional)
6. Get yourself an [Androzoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu/) token (optional)

## Usage

```
androidcrypto <path_to_yaml_configuration_file> -n <optionally a base64 encoded Neptune.ai token> -a <optiionally an Androzoo API token>
```

Ultimately, what the script will perform is fully defined by the experiment config file you provide, [see Architecture](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#architecture) or the [sample config](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/blob/master/sample_configs/sample_config.yml) for in-depth tutorial.

## Architecture

The tool divides its analysis into two major steps. One of them is called an *experiment*, the second phase concerns *evaluation* of the experiment. 

### Experiment

The experiment is fully defined by an experiment config, [see example](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/blob/master/sample_configs/sample_config.yml). The experiment is capable of performing five major tasks:

1. Download a dataset of APKs to work with (`download` task). Optionally, a dataset can be [loaded from disk](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#how-to-work-with-datasets), skipping this task.
2. Decompile the APKs into Androguard analysis objects (`decompile` task).
3. Analyze the usage of third-party libraries in the APK using own fork of LiteRadar (`third_party_libs` task)
4. Evaluate the usage of cryptographic API from the Androguard dx file (`evaluate` task)
5. Possibly label the file with [Euphony label](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83926508.pdf) (`label` task)

This list also sets the chronological order of the actions, e.g. step 4 cannot be done before step 2, etc. You can choose any subset of the tasks to be performed, e.g. 1,2,3 or just 3,4. Some of the tasks may be dependent on some external tools to run properly. Please make sure you have the integration covered according to the table below

| Task               | Tool to integrate                                                                                                | Can be turned off          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| All tasks          | [Neptune.ml](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#neptune-integration)                           | Yes,  in configuration file |
| `download`         | [Androzoo dataset](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#androzoo-integration)                    | Yes, skip the task   |
| `decompile`        | [Patched Androguard, jadx](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#androguard-and-jadx-integration) | You can decompile with DAD |
| `third_party_libs` | [Literadar](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#literadar-integration)                          | Yes, skip the task       |
| `evaluate`         | No tool needed                                                                                                   | |
| `label` | [Euphony csv files](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto#euphony-integration)| Yes, skip the task |


The experiment works with multiple apks concurrently, performing all four tasks (or their subset) chronologically.  Each of the tasks has its own configuration options, all residing in the experiment configuration file. All results are stored in a single json file called `records.json` held in the dataset folder.

## Dependencies

### Neptune integration

The project is meant to be fully integrated with [Neptune.ai](Neptune.ai). This allows us to track all experiments performed with the project. The `Team/Project_name` is to be supplied from the config file, whereas the personal API token is supplied as a command-line parameter. 

If you do not want to integrate with Neptune.ai, simply put `is_being_logged: False` to the experiment config and you're safe.

### Androzoo integration

The project is capable of working alongside the [Androzoo dataset](https://androzoo.uni.lu/). In order to be able to create datasets from the Androzoo database, you need to register in the Androzoo service and create your own API key. After that, you have to download the csv file of the Androzoo and shuffle the lines of it. Then, you simply provide the path to this csv file in your config (and your API token as command line parameter) and you're done, our script will automate the downloading itself. See ["How to work with datasets"](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/tree/master#how-to-work-with-datasets) for supplying your own dataset instead of Androzoo. 

### Androguard and Jadx integration

We decided to use [Jadx decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) with Androguard instead of default DAD. That is because Jadx decompiler produces cleaner source code. However, current version of Androguard contains bug yet to be resolved that prevents from using Jadx. Luckily, we have a fix. Until Androguard bug is fixed in the repository, deploy your own version with this fix: https://github.com/androguard/androguard/issues/763#issuecomment-558646108 (just modify the two lines). Note that Jadx doesn't work so smoothly with Androguard which in turn costs probably 25% of performance. This shouldn't be a problem as we should still be able to decompile 2 files per second on a fast machine. Thus 100k samples get decompiled in 14 hours.

Also, you need to have [Jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) installed and present in a path. You also have to setup path to your `jadx` binary in the experiment config file. [See examples](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/tree/master/sample_configs).

### Literadar integration

Detection of third-party libraries usage uses the fork of [Literadar](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/LiteRadar) script under the hood. That script is being executed as python2 process, so you need to have python2 functionable as well on your computer. Make sure to specify the path to the LiteRadar binary in the experiment config.  Make sure you use our forked version of LiteRadar that works out of the box.

### Euphony integration

TBA

## How to work with datasets

You can create your dataset as a result of the Download task (requires Androzoo API key) or supply your own dataset. If you want to create your own dataset, you have to supply the APKs and the `meta.yml` file. See the [example dataset](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/tree/master/notebooks). The file structure of the dataset folder is as follows. When the dataset is resolved internally by the script, a check for the presence of the `records.json` file is done. If not present, the file is created and is being gradually populated with results from various tasks. The folder structure of a dataset is as follows:

```
DatasetFolder/
+-- meta.yml
+-- records.json
|     +-- data/
|     +-- /apk
       |    +-- all_the_apk_files
```

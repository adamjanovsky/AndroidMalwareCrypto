# APK Dataset

- There are two ways of supplying the dataset for analysis: 

  1. Load own APKs from a disk.
  2. Command the `download` task to provide a dataset from Androzoo. 

  The folder [sample_dataset](https://github.com/adamjanovsky/AndroidMalwareCrypto/tree/master/sample_experiment/dataset) shows the form of a dataset (and is used in the sample experiment). The form of the folder is shown in the listing below. It should be noted that the parameters for the Androzoo sampling (how many samples to download, should they be malicious?, etc.) can be found in the `download` task configuration in the configuration file. 

```
DatasetFolder/
+-- meta.yml  # Store basic information about the dataset, you don't have to provide this
+-- records.json # Stores extracted data for each of the APKs, will get created automatically
|     +-- data/
|     +-- /apk
       |    +-- all_the_apk_files
|     +-- /dx
       |    +-- (possibly, dx files will be stored here), you don't have to provide this
```

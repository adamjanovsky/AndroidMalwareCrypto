Welcome to AndroidMalwareCrypto's documentation!
================================================

This tool allows for an analysis of cryptographic API in Android applications. The tool was especially developed to compare cryptographic API usage in benign vs. malicious applications and contains (weak) malware classifier based purely on cryptographic API features. We strive to provide end-to-end solution, automating all steps in the analysis:

1. Decompilation of APKs (:doc:`mining_crypto_api`),
2. collection of cryptographic API usage in the decompiled binaries (:doc:`mining_crypto_api`, :doc:`apk_datasets`),
3. exploratory data analysis of crypto API in your dataset (:doc:`data_preparation`, :doc:`exploratory_data_analysis`),
4. training and evaluation of malware classifier based on crypto API features (:doc:`classifier_training`),
5. explanations of the classifier using `SHAP <https://github.com/slundberg/shap>`_ (:doc:`classifier_interpretation`).

This documentation serves as a protocol to allow full replication of our experiments. Use the links in the list above (or table of contents) to navigate to specific step in our research.

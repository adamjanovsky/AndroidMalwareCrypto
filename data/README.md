# Data Folder

This folder contains the data for the experiments.
Even though due to AndroZoo restrictions only the hashes are available, this file describes how the data should be organized.

## Folder Structure

- `hashes.csv` - csv file that contains hashes of all the used samples
- `raw` - folder with raw dataset collected from AndroZoo using AndroidMalwareCrypto tool by Janovsky
	- `benign` - subfolder with benign samples in JSON format (`*.json`)
	- `malicious` - subfolder with malicious samples in JSON format (`*.json`)
- `prepared` - folder with prepared data (after feature engineering) for model training, each file in the folder is in format `OBJECTIVE/SPLIT.csv`
	- `OBJECTIVE` - objective can be `malware_detection`, `adware_detection`, `malware_labeling`,
	 `adware_labeling`, `malware_category_labeling`, `malware_versus_benign`, `adware_versus_benign`
	- `SPLIT` - split is from `train_X`, `train_y`, `validation_X`, `validation_y`, `test_X`, `test_y`
